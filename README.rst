About
=====

The land use and land cover samples are stored in a database to assist in the experiments of the Brazil Data Cube. **SAMPLE-DB** has the data model and functions to consult and store the land use and land cover samples. This repository, **SAMPLE-DB-UTILS**, has the utility functions that perform the transformation of different data formats to be stored by SAMPLE-DB.
To facilitate access to samples of land use and land cover stored in the database, a Python package called **SAMPLE.py** was developed. This package retrieves the land use and land cover samples that were made available via WFS by the GeoServer application.

For more information on SAMPLE-DB-UTILS, see:

- `sample-db <https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/sample-db>`_: SQLAlchemy models and utility functions to query and store data.
- `sample.py <https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/sample.py>`_: Python client library over a WFS endpoint for retrieving samples.
